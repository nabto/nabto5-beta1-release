# Nabto client SDK demo application
The Nabto client SDK demo application demonstrates how to open a
connection to a Nabto embedded SDK device and use it to stream data
and invoke RPC functionality on the device using CoAP. Two client
applications are currently available: the iOS demo for iOS devices,
and the cli demo for Linux and MacOS command lines. Both demos have
the same Nabto functionallities.
